This project leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) to implement a sophisticated face recognition system for office security. Utilizing AWS Rekognition, the system is designed to identify and authenticate individuals accessing the premises. The core functionality is encapsulated within AWS Lambda functions, housing the facial recognition codes for efficient and scalable execution. Data management is facilitated through Amazon DynamoDB, providing a reliable and scalable NoSQL database for storing crucial information. To enhance organization and security, two distinct S3 buckets are employedâ€”one dedicated to visitor data and another for employee records. AWS RestAPI ensures seamless communication and interaction with the system, offering a user-friendly interface for managing access and monitoring activities. This comprehensive AWS-based solution integrates cutting-edge facial recognition technology with robust cloud services to optimize office security and streamline access management.
